# TP Feedback for Team 21
                                        
**TP Grade**: A+
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences that relates well to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is clearly related to immersion design and works well
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed with good quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly analysed to form conclusions leading to future work, but quality of analysis may be lacking
                                        
## Documentation
a comprehensive README (clear/detailed instructions and architecture) and a well-made video demo (well-scripted articulations with good footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
demonstrated decent software development processes across some aspects of creating/delegating/monitoring work packets across members collaboratively
                                        
## Other feedback
Good articulation of design although some ideas were not explicitly linked to immersion, e.g., quiz mechanic could've been linked to flow (challenge). Most implementations were also well-related linked to the designs. Really good variety of implementation components (whiteboard, quiz) implemented. Really well done :) .

Flow and cybersickness seemed well applied but you guys did not mention why  only certain questions were chosen for presence. Decent attempt at analysing the results with reference to the data, although again the presence discussion lacks depth. Quantity was good.

Documentation - README had just sufficient info but architecture could've been more detailed. Video was nicely scripted and well edited :) , cool voice and choice of bg music.
Software engineering - Trello was used although the tasks shown were very high level and contained no details (e.g., acceptance criteria). Decent level of code activity demonstrated in repo though, and in combination, we can say the SE was pretty ok.
